# 📋 Documentation Consolidation Summary

> Project-wide documentation review and reorganization completed on October 5, 2025

## 🎯 Objective Completed

As requested, a comprehensive review of the entire MERN Project Management System was conducted from a full-stack engineering perspective. All scattered `.md` files have been reviewed, updated, and consolidated into a professional documentation structure.

## ✅ Actions Taken

├── API-DOCUMENTATION.md     # Complete API reference with examples
├── DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md      # Production deployment instructions
├── FEATURES.md              # Detailed feature documentation
